Due Date: Monday, September 25, 2017 @ 11:59pm <br>

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will explore a few properties of the binomial, normal, and Poisson distribution. I encourage you to discuss your solutions with other members of the class, but everyone should submit their own code. You are allowed to use the notes from class, and notes found online to help you work through the problem. Here are a few helpful resources:

- [Python 2 reference](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html)
- [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)


#### Question 1. Binomial Distributions [10 pts]

- Question 1a. Modify the coin flip example to print 100 flips from an unbalanced coin where p(heads) = 40% [Hint: adjust random.randint()]
- Question 1b. Plot the density of 10,000 trials with 100 flips of the unbalanced coin [Hint: see notes]
- Question 1c. What is the mean and standard deviation of the flip results? [Hint: see notes]
- Question 1d. Overlay the binomial and normal distributions on this density using this mean and stdev [Hint: see notes]
- Question 1e. What is the probability of seeing 25 heads in 100 flips from this unbalanced coin? [Hint: see notes]



### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single Jupiter notebook (.ipynb) that includes your name, email address, and all relevant figures and text (as needed). Make sure to clearly label each of the subproblems and clearly label your plots. Submit your solutions by emailing the document as an attachment to "jhubiomedicalresearch at gmail dot com" by 11:59pm on Sept 25. Name your file as "Lastname.Firstname.Asn1.ipynb" (replace LastName.Firstname with your own name :-). If you submit after this time, you will start to use up your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 4 late days for the entire semester!
