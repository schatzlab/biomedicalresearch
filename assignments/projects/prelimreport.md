## Preliminary Project Report
Assignment Date: Nov 8, 2017 <br>
Due Date: Friday, Nov 17, 2017 @ 11:59pm <br>

Each student should email a PDF of your preliminary project proposal (2-3 pages) to  "jhubiomedicalresearch at gmail dot com" by 11:59pm on Friday November 17, 2017.

The preliminary report should have:
- Title of your project
- Name and email addresses
- 1 paragraph Abstract summarizing the project
- 1 paragraph of Introduction
- 1 paragraph of Methods that you are using
- 1 paragraph of Results, describing the data evaluated and any any preliminary results
- 1 paragraph of Discussion (what you have seen or expect to see)
- 1 figure showing a preliminary result
- References to relevant papers and data

The preliminary report can use any style, although clearly mark each section (Title, Name, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References). Feel free to reuse text from your proposal if it is still appropriate.

Later, you will present your project in class after Thanksgiving. You will also submit your final written report (5-7 pages) of your project in Mid December

Please use Piazza if you have any general questions!
