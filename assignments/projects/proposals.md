## Project Proposal
Assignment Date: September 25, 2017 <br>
Due Date: Monday, October 2, 2017 @ 11:59pm <br>

Please email a PDF of your project proposal (1/2 to 1 page) to  "jhubiomedicalresearch at gmail dot com" by 11:59pm on Monday October 2, 2017.

The proposal should have the following components:
- Short title for your proposal
- Your name
- Email addresses
- Description of what you hope to do and how you will do it:
    - What is the key question you hope to address?
    - What data will you use to study it? Are all the data you need available now? When will they be available?
    - What techniques (experimental or computational) will you use to generate and analyze the data?
    - What are the desired results?
- References to relevant papers
- References/URLs to datasets that you will be studying (Note you can also use simulated data)

After submitting your proposal, we will schedule a time to discuss your proposal, especially to ensure you have access to the data that you need and you have a clear path forward for analyzing it. The sooner that you submit your proposal, the sooner we can schedule the meeting. No late days can be used for this project.

Later, you will present your project in class at the the end of the semester. You will also submit a written report (5-7 pages) of your project, formatting as scholarly article with separate sections for the Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and References. More details will be provided later in the semester.
