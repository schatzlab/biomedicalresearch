# JHU EN.601.452 / AS.020.415 Computational Biomedical Research & Advanced Biomedical Research
## Project Presentations

### Recommended outline for your talk (1 minute per slide):

0. Title Slide: Who are you, title, date, mentor
1. Intro 1: Whats the big idea???
2. Intro 2: More specifically, what are you trying to learn?
3. Methods 1: What did you try?
4. Methods 2: What is the key idea?
5. Data 1: What data are you looking at?
6. Data 2: Anything notable about the data?
7. Results 1: What did you see!
8. Results 2: Does it work?
9. Discussion: What did you learn from this study & what is your future work?
10. Acknowledgements: Who helped you along the way?

I strongly *discourage* you from trying to give a live demo as they are too unpredictable for a short talk. If you have running software you want to show, use a "cooking show" approach, where you have screen shots of the important steps.

Presentations will be a total of 12 minutes: 10 minutes for the presentation, followed by 2 minutes for questions. We will strictly keep to the schedule to ensure that everyone can present in class.
