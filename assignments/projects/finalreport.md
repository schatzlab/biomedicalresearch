## Project Final Report
Due Date: Wed, Dec 20, 2017 @ 11:59pm <br>

Each student should email a PDF of your final project report (6-10 pages) to  "jhubiomedicalresearch at gmail dot com" by 11:59pm on Wednesday December 20, 2017

The report should have:
- Title of your project
- Name and email addresses of you, your mentor, and anyone else that you worked closely with
- 1 paragraph Abstract summarizing the project
- ~1 page of Introduction
- ~1-2 page of Methods that you are using (at least 1 figure of the method/workflow)
- ~1-2 page of Results, describing the data evaluated and your results (plan for 3 - 4 figures showing data and results)
- ~1 page of Discussion (what you have seen or expect to see)
- 1 paragraph of Acknowledgements
- 5 to 20 References to relevant papers and data

The report can use any style, although clearly mark each section (Title, Name, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgements, References). 
You can use the [Bioinformatics Templates](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/submission_online) if you wish but they are not required.
Feel free to reuse text from your preliminary report if it is still appropriate. 

Please use Piazza if you have any general questions!
