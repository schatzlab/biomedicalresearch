# EN.601.452 / AS.020.415 Computational Biomedical Research &amp; Advanced Biomedical Research
Class Hours: Monday + Wednesday @ 3p - 3:50p in Malone 107 <br>
Office Hours: Wednesday @ 4-5p in Malone 323 and by appointment

**The goal of this course is to prepare undergraduates to understand and perform state-of-the-art biomedical research.** This will be accomplished through three main components: (1) classroom-style lectures on cross cutting techniques for biomedical research focusing on data visualization, statistical inference, and scientific computing; (2) research presentations from distinguished faculty on their active research projects; and (3) a major research project to be performed under the mentorship of a professor. Students will present their research during an in-class symposium at the end of the semester. Grading will be based on homework exercises, a written research proposal, an oral research presentation, and a final research report.

### Recommended Prerequisites
- Online introduction to Unix/Linux. Students are strongly recommended to complete one of the following online tutorials (or both) before class begins. 
  - [Code academy's Intro to Unix](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/environment/exercises/bash-profile)
  - [Command line bootcamp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=9xnbkx6eaof)
  - [Unix and Perl for Biologists](http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/Unix_and_Perl/)
  - [Minimal Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/)
- Access to a Linux Machine, or Install [VirtualBox](https://github.com/schatzlab/appliedgenomics/blob/master/assignments/virtualbox.md) (Unfortuantely, even Mac will not work correctly for some programs)
